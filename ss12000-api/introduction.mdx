description: 'The SS12000 API is a structured implementation of the Swedish SS 12000 standard'
---

SS 12000 is a Swedish standard for data communication in the education sector. It defines how systems should exchange information to ensure interoperability and data consistency. 

Our API includes a representation of SS 12000 and follows its structure for relevant data models and processes.

> **Note:** We are planning to improve this SS12000 documentation to provide better clarity and more comprehensive information. The API reference is currently written in Swedish as it has been copied directly from Skolverket's original documentation.
