# Directory API

The Directory API is part of Meitner’s RESTful API suite. It enables organizations to programmatically manage admin-controlled resources. Some example use cases include:
- Managing schools and their properties
- Creating and managing groups and group memberships
- Creating and managing user types:
  - Employees
  - Guardians
  - Students

The API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) principles. It uses predictable, resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies for `POST` and `PATCH` requests (_when a body is required_), and returns JSON-encoded responses. Query parameters can be used for pagination.

Standard HTTP verbs and status codes are used throughout, and all requests require authentication.

> **Note:** The Meitner API does not support bulk updates — you can modify only one object per request.

## Endpoint

Meitner's Directory API is available at:

```
https://api.meitner.se/directory/v1
```

For testing and debugging, you can use our staging environment:

```
https://api.staging.meitner.se/directory/v1
```

## Authentication

All requests to the Meitner Directory API must be authenticated.

Authentication is handled via two required headers:

- `Client-ID`: Your public client identifier.
- `Client-Secret`: A secret key tied to your client ID.

```curl
curl -H "Client-ID: your-client-id" -H "Client-Secret: your-client-secret" https://api.meitner.se/directory/v1/student
```

We are currently evaluating improvements to our authentication flow to enhance security and simplify integration. Future changes may include rotating secrets, OAuth support, or scoped access tokens.

## Resource Structure

The Meitner API uses a consistent and straightforward structure for working with resources:

- `POST /student` Creates a new student.
- `PATCH /student/:id` Updates an existing student.
- `GET /student` Lists all students. Supports `limit` and `offset` query parameters for pagination. See the [Pagination](directory/pagination) section for more details.
- `GET /student/:id` Retrieves a specific student by ID.
- `DELETE /student/:id` Deletes a specific student.
- `POST /student/_search` Supports advanced filtering using a type-safe JSON body. See the [Search/Filtering](directory/search-filtering) section for more details.

> **Note:** Not all resources support every method—for example, creation may not be allowed for read-only resources.  
> Some resources may also expose additional custom methods when needed.

## Requests

### Body

We aim to keep request bodies minimal, requiring as few fields as possible.

When creating a resource (`POST`), default values are applied automatically where possible. You only need to provide values if you want to override the defaults. Nullable fields will typically default to `null` if not provided.

### Updates

The Meitner API uses the `PATCH` method for updates, which allows **partial updates**. You only need to include the fields you want to change.

We also differentiate between `undefined` and `null` values:

- If a field is omitted from the request body, it is treated as **undefined** and left unchanged.
- If a field is included with the value `null`, it will explicitly **overwrite** the existing value with `null`.

#### Example

Let’s say a student has the following data:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

If you want to update only the email:

```http
PATCH /student/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "new-email@example.com"
}
```

Result:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "new-email@example.com"
}
```

If you want to remove the email entirely:

```http
PATCH /student/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": null
}
```

Result:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": null
}
```

#### Arrays

For array fields, any update replaces the entire array:

- Sending an array like `["id1", "id2"]` will fully replace the existing values.
- Sending an empty array (`[]`) or `null` will **clear** all existing values.

For example, a guardian’s `studentIDs` field will be fully overwritten if included in the request, regardless of its previous contents.

## Responses

### Body

When retrieving, creating, or updating a resource, the API returns the resource directly in the JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": ""
}
```

When the response includes multiple rows for a resource, the body returns a data field with an array:

```json
{
   "data": [
      {
         "name": "Alice",
         "email": ""
      }
   ]
}
```

### Status Codes

The Meitner API uses a fixed set of standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of a request:

| Code | Meaning                            | Description |
|------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `200` | OK                                | The request succeeded and a response body is included. |
| `201` | Created                           | The resource was successfully created. |
| `204` | No Content                        | The request succeeded but there's no response body (commonly used for deletes). |
| `400` | Bad Request                       | The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters. |
| `401` | Unauthorized                      | The request is missing valid authentication credentials. |
| `403` | Forbidden                         | Authentication succeeded, but the user is not allowed to perform the operation. |
| `404` | Not Found                         | The requested resource or endpoint does not exist. This can happen if a resource ID is invalid or the route is unknown. |
| `409` | Conflict | The request could not be completed due to a conflict, such as a resource with dependencies that prevent deletion. |
| `422` | Unprocessable Entity              | The request was well-formed but failed validation (e.g. invalid field format or constraints). |
| `429` | Too Many Requests                 | The rate limit has been exceeded. See the [Rate Limiting](directory/rate-limiting) section for more details. |
| `500` | Internal Server Error             | An unexpected error occurred on the server side. |

> **Note:** If a request fails, the response body typically includes an error object with more details.  
> If a `500` error occurs, Meitner staff is automatically alerted and will investigate the issue.
