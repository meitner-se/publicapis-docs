description: 'How to use the /_search endpoint in the **Meitner Directory API** for advanced filtering.'
---

Some resources in the Directory API support a `/_search` endpoint, which allows for advanced filtering and querying.

### Request

Search requests are sent as a `POST` request to:

```
POST /:resource/_search
```

The request body must be a JSON object with a `filter` field that defines your query conditions.

### JSON Structure

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "orCondition": true,
    "nestedFilters": [],
    "equals": {},
    "notEquals": {},
    "greater": {},
    "smaller": {},
    "greaterOrEqual": {},
    "smallerOrEqual": {},
    "contains": {},
    "notContains": {},
    "like": {},
    "notLike": {},
    "null": {},
    "notNull": {}
  }
}
```

### Filter Operators

| Operator         | Description                                    | Applies To                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `equals`         | Exact match on one or more fields              | All field types                        |
| `notEquals`      | Not equal to the given value                   | All field types                        |
| `greater`        | Greater than the given value                   | `Date`, `Timestamp`, `Integer`         |
| `smaller`        | Smaller than the given value                   | `Date`, `Timestamp`, `Integer`         |
| `greaterOrEqual` | Greater than or equal to the given value       | `Date`, `Timestamp`, `Integer`         |
| `smallerOrEqual` | Smaller than or equal to the given value       | `Date`, `Timestamp`, `Integer`         |
| `contains`       | Field contains the value                       | `String`, `Date`, `UUID`, `Enum`, `Array` |
| `notContains`    | Field does not contain the value               | `String`, `Date`, `UUID`, `Enum`, `Array` |
| `like`           | Partial string match (case-insensitive)        | `String`                               |
| `notLike`        | Partial string mismatch                        | `String`                               |
| `null`           | Field must be null                             | Nullable fields and arrays             |
| `notNull`        | Field must not be null                         | Nullable fields and arrays             |

### Logical Operators

- `orCondition`:  
  When `true`, filters at this level are combined using **OR** logic (any condition can match).  
  When `false` or omitted, filters use **AND** logic (all conditions must match).  
  This applies both at the root level and inside `nestedFilters`.

- `nestedFilters`:  
  A list of additional filter objects that are evaluated as a group, allowing for nested logic.

> **Note:** Field names used in filters must match the exact field names defined in the resource schema (typically camelCase).

### Example: Search Request

Find all **StudentPlacements** that are in `schoolYear` 7 **and** either:
- have an `endDate` after 2025-04-24, **or**
- have no `endDate` at all.

```http
POST /student-placement/_search
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "orCondition": false,
    "equals": {
      "schoolYear": "7"
    },
    "nestedFilters": [
      {
        "orCondition": true,
        "greater": {
          "endDate": "2025-04-24"
        },
        "null": {
          "endDate": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Equivalent SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM student_placements WHERE school_year = '7' AND (end_date > '2025-04-24' OR end_date IS NULL);
```

> This example helps illustrate how `orCondition` and `nestedFilters` map to grouped `AND`/`OR` conditions in SQL.
