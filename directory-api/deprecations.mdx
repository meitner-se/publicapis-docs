Meitner’s API is still in its early days, and currently only has one version—V1.

As the product grows, the API will evolve too. We take breaking changes seriously, especially knowing that many developers rely on this API for their applications and integrations. When a breaking change is necessary, we’ll proactively reach out to affected developers and give you plenty of time to adapt. In some cases, deprecated functionality will remain as non-functional stubs to avoid immediate breakage.

All deprecations and changes will be announced in our changelog and communicated in our Slack community's [API announcements channel](https://meitnerapi.slack.com/archives/C08JMJ5J1DW).
