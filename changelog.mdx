<Update label="October 2025">
  We're excited to announce the release of our official client libraries for C# and Python! These libraries make it easier to integrate with the Meitner API.

  - **C# Client Library**: [github.com/meitner-se/api-client-csharp](https://github.com/meitner-se/api-client-csharp)
  - **Python Client Library**: [github.com/meitner-se/api-client-python](https://github.com/meitner-se/api-client-python)

  Both libraries provide full type safety, async support, and comprehensive documentation to help you get started quickly.
